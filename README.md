1. Platform Engineering: By 2026, 80% of large software engineering organizations will establish platform engineering teams as internal providers of reusable services, components and tools for application delivery, up from 45% in 2022.

1. AI Everywhere<br />
   In 2023, artificial intelligence will become real in organizations. No-code AI, with its easy drag-and-drop interfaces, will enable any business to leverage its power to create more intelligent products and services.

1. Parts of the Metaverse Will Become Real<br />
   Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technology will continue to advance. One area to watch is the work environment in the metaverse — in 2023, I predict that we’ll have more immersive meeting environments where we can talk, brainstorm, and co-create together.

1. Bridging the Digital and Physical World<br />
   We’re already seeing an emerging bridge between the digital and physical worlds, and this trend will continue in 2023. There are two components of this merger: digital twin technology and 3D printing.

1. Increasingly Editable Nature<br />
   We will live in a world where we can make changes to material, plants, and even humans by editing them. Nanotechnology will enable us to create materials with completely new features, such as water resistance and self-healing capabilities.

1. Quantum > **this is my absolute Favorite trend** <br />
   Right now, there is a worldwide race to develop quantum computing at scale.

1. Progress in Green Technology<br />
   One of the biggest challenges the world is facing right now is putting the brakes on our carbon emissions so we can tackle the climate crisis.

1. Robots Will Become More Human<br />
   In 2023, robots will become even more like humans — in appearance and capability. These types of robots will be used in the real world as event greeters, bartenders, concierges, and companions for older adults. They’ll also perform complex tasks in warehouses and factories as they work alongside humans in manufacturing and logistics.
